### ShippingProject
This project simulates a mail center that processes and tracks shipping items (letters, envelopes, crates, etc.) from a basic GUI.  In addition to maintaining an inventory of shipping items, users (employees and customers) are managed as well.  At the end of use, instead of saving inventory and user data to a text file, the program saves it to a serialized object file, "ShippingStore.ser".  Upon reopening the program, the inventory and user data is reloaded.
